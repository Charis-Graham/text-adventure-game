Those houses, you know, contain wives and husbands and children - families. You feel almost sorry for the family in the house before you; they have reported a missing person - a husband and father. The two-storied building before you looks like every other house on the cobbled road, but not.... There is something foreboding about it, like a dark cloud hangs over the cheery building with bright flowers boxed in the front. Maybe this is due to the recent loss of the master of the house. With a sigh, you know there is only thing for you to do as the inspector sent by Scotland Yard: enter the house and begin your investigation.\n\n[type "help" to get list of commands]\n',

The floors are a dark lacquered wood laid over by richly colored oriental rugs. The walls are covered in a dark olive green wallpaper.

Finally, your eyes settle on the work table situated in the middle of the room. On it appears to be a recently gutted fish. A rough cough draws your attention to a weathered middle-aged woman in the corner whose uniform notifies you that she must be the housekeeper.

It is on one of the couches that you see who must be the lady of the house in her expensive layered dress.

In the corner of the garden, you see a small boy holding a circular device that has a magnifying glass in the middle.

In the corner there is a toilet with a dangling chain with which to flush. On the opposite wall, you see a basin with a mirror bolted to the wall above.

He said that Mrs. Menteuse was irrational, so maybe she was the culprit all along.\n\n With this conclusion in mind, you decide to go and confront Mrs. Menteuse.

Her face is impassive and you feel a shiver go down your spine at the cold look in her eyes. \n\n"Ah... I see you found the letter," she remarks coldly. "I really should not have trusted the key with that useless housekeeper, or the decoder with my waste of space of a child." Her demeanor suddenly changes and her face splits into a wide manic grin. You take a small step back in fear. \n\n"Oh, do not worry, dear." Mrs. Menteuse continues to smile, "There is nothing to fear. You just know too much now. Luckily, I have the perfect solution." You want to speak, but fear grasps at your throat, physically holding the words in. \n\n"You, Inspector, I think, will find the rest of your stay with us most enjoyable." Suddenly, you feel a sharp pain at the back of your head and everything goes black. \n\n')
